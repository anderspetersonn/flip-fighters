Flip Fighters: The Game

Grab a friend and tell 'em to come play the new hit classic produced by Master Pushers: Flip Fighters. Once their excitement has died down, head over to the keyboard and pick out your controls, or stick with the defaults we've decided on after centuries of playtesting. Our map artisans have homebrewed some spicy levels for you and your buddies to enjoy, so make sure to try them all out!

Using the controls that you carefully crafted a minute ago, begin mashing buttons that correspond to the direction you're trying to move. If you manage to flip in the air, you'll get a cool bonus to assist in the annihilation of your frenemy. If a magic orb falls from the sky, go ahead and pick it up: see what happens. If you can't even manage that, the attack key will do a melee slap that will humiliate and demean your opponent, which is arguably just as viable of a strategy as the intensely powerful magic orbs we designed.

Get your opponent's health to 0 or knock them off the platform to win!
